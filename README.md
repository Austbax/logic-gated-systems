# Security & Financial Logic Simulations (Python)

This repository contains a collection of Python-based simulations designed to explore back-end logic, security enforcement, and data persistence. These projects demonstrate my transition from security analysis to technical implementation.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Financial Transaction Engine (`banking-sim/`)
An Object-Oriented (OOP) simulation of a banking system.
* **Core Logic:** Manages account states (balances), validates deposit/withdrawal amounts, and prevents overdrafts.
* **Security Integration:** Features a pre-access password complexity validator.

### 2. Security Policy Validator (`auth-security/`)
A script designed to enforce credential complexity requirements.
* **Core Logic:** Utilizes iterative string analysis to ensure passwords meet length, numeric, and special character requirements.
* **Use Case:** Demonstrates foundational knowledge of Identity & Access Management (IAM) protocols.

### 3. Persistent State Engine (`logic-engines/`)
A logic-gated simulation focusing on data integrity and error handling.
* **Core Logic:** Uses **File I/O** to maintain an audit trail of user actions in an external `.txt` file.
* **Resilience:** Implements `try/except` blocks to handle system exceptions and maintain operational uptime.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **Languages:** Python (Classes, Logic Gates, File Handling, Exception Trapping)
* **Concepts:** State Management, Data Persistence, Security Policy Enforcement
